Here's a list of the possible recommendations I want you to consider providing to the potential victim. I want you to analyze the current transcript and then choose the best first course of action from our list of possible recommended interventions.

Here's the list of recommendations:
-Get the name of the company, then use Google to look up the phone number for that company and call it back.
-Ask the caller to provide identifying information about myself.
-Tell the caller you'll call them back. Hang up and call a relative to tell them what happened. 
-Be extra cautious if the caller is telling you this is urgent or that you can't hang up the phone.
